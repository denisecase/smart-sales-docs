# D4.1 Data Warehousing

After preparing data for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, the next step in the BI (Business Intelligence) lifecycle involves creating a place to store this data in a structured repository.
This module explores why these storage solutions are critical and how they are structured to support BI initiatives.

## Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake vs. Lakehouse

### Data Warehouse
A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository designed to support decision making. 
It stores integrated data from multiple sources that has been cleaned, transformed, and structured into a defined schema. 
Data Warehouses are optimized for fast retrieval of data, making them ideal for querying and reporting.

Examples include:
- **Amazon Redshift**: A widely used cloud-based data warehouse known for its fast performance and scalability.
- **Oracle Exadata**: A combined hardware and software offering that provides a high-performance data warehouse solution.
- **IBM Db2 Warehouse**: Known for its robust analytics capabilities and support for large volumes of data.

### Data Lake
A **Data Lake** stores raw data in its native format, including structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. 
The flexibility of a Data Lake allows it to store vast amounts of data without prior organization, making it suitable for big data and machine learning where data structure and requirements are not fully known upfront.

Examples include:
- **Amazon S3**: Often used as a data lake due to its vast storage capacity and durability.
- **Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage**: Integrates with Azure ecosystem tools to provide a comprehensive data lake solution.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Used by organizations leveraging the Google Cloud Platform for analytics and machine learning.


### Lakehouse
A **Lakehouse** combines the best features of both Data Lakes and Data Warehouses. 
It provides the vast storage capabilities of a Data Lake and the management features of a Data Warehouse, allowing for both high flexibility and efficient data querying.

Examples include:
- **Databricks Delta Lake**: Offers ACID transactions and scalable metadata handling over a data lake.
- **Snowflake**: Although primarily a data warehouse, it incorporates many features of data lakes, promoting a lakehouse approach.


## Understanding Dimensions and Facts

In the context of a Data Warehouse, data is often organized into **dimensions** and **facts**, which are fundamental to understanding how to effectively design and use a Data Warehouse.

### Dimensions
**Dimensions** refer to the descriptive attributes related to business entities. 
These are the aspects by which analytic measures are segmented, categorized, and described. 
Common dimensions include time, geography, products, and customers. 
For instance, in a sales analysis, dimensions might include the product being sold, the store selling the product, and the time period of sales.

### Facts
**Facts** are the measurements or metrics that are stored and analyzed. 
In a business context, facts are typically numerical values that can be aggregated – for example, sales revenue, units sold, or total costs. 
These are the core of analytical queries and are often the focus of business reporting and analysis.

## The Importance of Good Design in BI

The design of a Data Warehouse directly influences its effectiveness in supporting business intelligence processes. Well-designed storage solutions reflect:

- Proper structuring and indexing of data can drastically reduce the time it takes to retrieve insights.
- Good design ensures that the warehouse can grow with the business, handling increasing amounts of data and queries without performance loss.
- A well-structured warehouse or lakehouse helps maintain data integrity and consistency.
- As business needs evolve, a well-designed warehouse can adapt to changes in data requirements.

## SQLite for Data Warehouse Simulation

SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a small C library. 
Unlike traditional data warehouses that require complex setups, SQLite databases are stored in a single  file, simplifying data management and making it accessible without the need for running and configuring a separate database server.

We will use SQLite to simulate the design and implementation of a data warehouse and then use ETL to load our data into the system.
